|Application integration patterns for microservices                                              |One of the implications of applying the microservices architectural style is that a lot of communication between components is done over the network. To achieve the promises of microservices, this communication needs to happen in a loosely coupled manner. In this session, learn fundamental application integration patterns based on messaging and connect them to real-world use cases in a microservices scenario. The session also describes benefits that asynchronous messaging can have over REST APIs for communication between microservices.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |https://virtual.awsevents.com/media/1_0ejkpsvk|
|Reliability, consistency, and confidence through immutability                                   |Immutable infrastructure is a model in which no updates, security patches, or configuration changes happen in place on production systems. If any change is needed, a new version of the architecture is built and deployed. Since changes aren’t allowed in immutable infrastructure, you can be sure about the state of the deployed system. Immutable infrastructures are more consistent, reliable, and predictable, and they simplify many aspects of software development and operations by preventing common issues related to mutability. This session dives deep into this topic, and you learn why immutable infrastructure is an important concept in cloud architecture.                                                                                                                                                |https://virtual.awsevents.com/media/1_6klcimyj|

|Simplifying delivery as code with Spinnaker and Kubernetes                                      |Software delivery can seem simple at first. Step 1: Build code. Step 2: Deploy application. Step 3: The end. Complexity often sneaks into our processes uninvited, disguised as scale, testing, auditing, sharing, etc. Delightfully simple workflows can quickly balloon into complex pipelines that require operators to see around every corner and, in many cases, are directly at odds with the declarative infrastructure processes operators love to build. In this session, Netflix and AWS discuss their collaboration on Spinnaker’s next-gen vision for transitioning from an imperative mix of pipelines and stages to a more declarative description of end goals and bring the “delightful” back to “delivery.”                                                                                                       |https://virtual.awsevents.com/media/1_lz4s3pei|
